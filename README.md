# LogisticsApplication
This application uses uniform cost search and heuristic algorithms to find the best path between two nodes on the map.
You can either add your own nodes to the map or use a pre-drawn map.

To make your own map, click Functions.
Click New Marker to place a node. 
Click Edit => Connect Markers to draw a path between two nodes.

To use a pre-drawn map, click Re-Draw.

To find the best path between two nodes, click Run Logistics.
Then, click a starting node, and an ending node.

After an ideal path is found, information is displayed at the bottom of the window.
The length of the path in miles is displayed, followed by the number of nodes expanded in each algorithm.

"Expansions" relates to uniform cost search and "Heuristic Expansions" relates to the heuristic algorithm.
